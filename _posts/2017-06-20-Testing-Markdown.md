Humourously yours is a great web series about the life of a stand up comic in India. 
It has been created by TVF, who have a knack of writing scripts which appeal to the new generation. 
Who said Indians dont have a funny bone.
The main man is Vipul Goyal and his good friend Bhushi. Bhushi is like the Harami friend you have. Doesn't care a damn about what shit you are into, but is ever present to give you company for a drink.
Here is one super quote from him.
>I live my life for 3 W's. 
Weed, Wine And Wagina.

This is how Bhushi looks(demonstrating how to add inline images)
