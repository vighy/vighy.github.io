Today I complete one year as a SydneySider. The beauty of this place and general work culture gives us the much wanted quality of life we seek.

I miss my family and friends back home. But I have experienced living independently for the first time in my life. Paying rent, bills and taking care of the baby full time without any help(except from the wife, of course). I am celebrating by gulping a panadol and water. (Flu from my daughter)

The journey has been good so far and I hope it will get better. 

There are too many places to visit around the city and once me and my wife gets stable well paying jobs, we should be out exploring the city every weekend.
